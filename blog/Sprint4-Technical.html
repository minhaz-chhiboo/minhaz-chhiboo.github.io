		<h1>Sprint 4</h1>

		<h3>THANKS FOR VISITING MY Sprint 4 TEchnical blog.</h3>

		<p>
			There were many road blocks during this sprint but one that I could recall
			was the code readability challenge. I was having difficulty trying to
			adjust tab spaces, but after watching a youtube video on it and playing
			around with the settings in vs code I had managed to get there.
		</p>

		<p>
			Another problem I was facing challenges on was recalling how to execute
			java script functions during the kata challenges. The way I managed to
			working around this was using a java script cheat sheet book that I have
			which helps in creating and executing functions. DUring the process I felt
			very fustrated as I was falling behind and had so much to catch up on.

			I am still trying to get to grips with sprint 4 but I am semi confident
			now in reading error messages. I utilised the rubber duckymethod to help
			me solve some of the error while doing the challenges. I did not have a
			duck but I used my action figure toy instead. It helped me a lot as I was
			explain the problem it was making more sense as I was breaking it down
			line by line. I am still working on building my confidence in asking my
			peers for help when I get stuck, I tend to usually ask if I am really
			stuck and am desperate for help.
