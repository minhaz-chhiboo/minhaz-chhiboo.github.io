			<h3>Thanks for visiting my Sprint 4 Technical blog.</h3>

			<p class="p1">
				There were many road blocks during this sprint but one that I could
				recall was the code readability challenge. I was having difficulty
				trying to adjust tab spaces, but after watching a youtube video on it
				and playing around with the settings in vs code I had managed to get
				there.
			</p>

			<p class="p1">
				Another problem I was facing challenges on was recalling how to execute
				java script functions during the kata challenges. The way I managed to
				working around this was using a java script cheat sheet book that I have
				which helps in creating and executing functions. During the process I
				felt very fustrated as I was falling behind and had so much to catch up
				on.

				I am still trying to get to grips with sprint 4 but I am semi confident
				now in reading error messages. I utilised the rubber duckymethod to help
				me solve some of the error while doing the challenges. I did not have a
				duck but I used my action figure toy instead. It helped me a lot as I
				was explain the problem it was making more sense as I was breaking it
				down line by line. I am still working on building my confidence in
				asking my peers for help when I get stuck, I tend to usually ask if I am
				really stuck and am desperate for help.
