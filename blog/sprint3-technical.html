		<h1>HTML, JavaScript, CSS</h1>

		<h3 class="sp3t">THANKS FOR VISITING MY HTML,CSS AND JS BLOG.</h3>

		<h4>
			First lets just outline the diffrences between the three in a simplistic
			manner for they non techy audiance.
		</h4>

		<p>
			Bassically you can think of HTML as the presentation and CSS as the design
			and JS as functionality on a web page. You can think of it like a magazine
			where HTML is the content and CSS is the fancy colours and the layout of
			the content. If you did not use css you would just have a resemblence of a
			book where there is only words and no fancy colours or layouts
		</p>

		<h4>Lets discuss flow and loops</h4>

		<p>
			Basically flow and loops help running code multiple times as well as
			running it with certain conditions or as we call it variables.
		</p>

		<p>
			Lets take a real life example to make more sense of flow and loops. Lets
			say you like to have coffee everyday but whether that coffee you will have
			is hot or cold depends on the climate. So if it is cold you will have a
			hot coffee and if the it is cold you will have a cold coffee.
		</p>

		<p>
			Loops can be looked at as a routine or things that happen repititively
			unless something else happens which stops the routine from taking place
			again. For example the heatpump turns on every morning at 7am to 10pm. If
			the power went of that day the heatpump would not turn on hence breaking
			the loop.
		</p>

		<h4>What is the DOM and can you use it.</h4>

		<p>
			DOM stands for "Document Object Model" and is basically a way for JS to be
			able to change the HTML Document that is loaded on your browser. Basically
			it changes the HTML from being static. HTML DOM can be used with a
			programing language like JS.
		</p>

		<h4>Accesing data from arrays versus objects</h4>

		<p>
			Arrays can have multiple string values hence when trying to access data
			within a array you will need to specify the number of the contents within
			the array. Basically within one array you have multiple string values and
			each value is assigned a number starting from 0. Accessing data within a
			object is simply a means of naming the object and then its properties.
		</p>

		<h4>What are functions and why are they useful</h4>

		<p>
			Functions in JS give the ability for certain peices of code to run. FOr
			example if you needed a window to on a website to open up all the time you
			would just create a function so that this window pops up automatically.
			You can then start putting in variables so that you can control when and
			at what points the window appears.
