		<h1>Reflection Foundation Core SKills</h1>

		<h3 class="sp55">
			Hi and welcome to my Sprint5 cultural blog post. In this post we will
			review some of the core learnings covered throughout foundations.
		</h3>

		<h5>
			What are three new things you have learned about yourself and your ego as
			a result of the core learning?
		</h5>

		<p>
				<ul>I learnt that I am very bad with manageing time.</ul>
				<ul>I learnt that I learn best by doing things that I learnt more often.</ul>
				<ul>I learnt more about my emotional state and emotional intelligence.</ul>
		</p>

		<h5>
			What are the role of values, empathy and self awareness in learning and
			programming?
		</h5>
		<p>
				I believe that self awareness is critical when trying to learn new things. If you are about to be aware of the states you are in you can learn more effectively by changing your state.

		</p>
		<h5>What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h5>

			<p>
					The amount of concepts and learning material covered within the 5 weeks really suprised me.

			</p>

		<h5>What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h5>

		<p>
				I initially found git and git hub difficult but now I feel I have mastered it however I still struggle with javascript.
		</p>

		<h5>
			Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time
			focusing on core learning in a web development bootcamp course?
		</h5>
			<p>
					I believe it is important to have the good understanding of the state you are in and also know about you wellbeing. The core work helps to build this in a individual which then can postively contribute to a better learning experience.

			</p>

		<h5>
			Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of
			time? Should you have just used that time to practicing programming
			instead? Justify your answer.
		</h5>

			<p>
					It was good to learn new things but I believe it could be cut down a little bit so we have more time to focus on programming. But the core content was really good.
