		<h1>Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset</h1>

		<h3>
			Hi and welcome to my latest Sprint4 cultural blog post. In this post I
			will be sharing some information about my research on the topic of
			Neuroplasticity and Growth Mindset, what it is, and why it is relevant
		</h3>

		<h5>So lets get started, What is Neuroplasticity</h5>
		<p>
			Neuroplasticity is the brains ability to expand and grow when learning and
			changeing. This is because the brain has the ability to change or expand
			like plastic hence why the name. Simply put Neuroplasticity is when your
			brain's neural pathways are altered as an effect of environmental,
			behavioral, and neural change. When you are exposed to new information you
			brain starts to change and create new pathways. Those pathways expand the
			more frequently you are exposed to that information.
		</p>

		<p>
			Neuroplasticity happens continually as you learn and memorize new data.
			One way we can take advantage of Neuroplasticity while learning is by
			being exposed to the same information frequently. This can be done in many
			forms such as reading material memorising or even practising and
			implementing what you are learning. We can use this principle when trying
			to learn coding or a new language. The more we code using a specific
			language the more better we will become at it and it will become easier to
			store in our brains.
		</p>

			Below I have pasted a link to a website which has amazing information and
			research studies on Neuroplasticity which you can read to learn more about
			the principles of Neuroplasticity. There is also a bonus ted talk which
			really helps breakdown the postive effects of increasing Neuroplasticity.

		<h5>Growth Mindset and what is it</h5>

		<p>
			Being able to grow or learn things in life starts of by first requiring a
			mental change. You need to be in the right type of mindset to be able to
			grow and adapt and to learn new things what ever they maybe. This is where
			being in a growth mindset mentally is the key. Having this type of mindset
			allows for a person to recognise that abilities can be developed over time
			with effort and consistency. This type of mindset can be developed in all
			aspects of life. The opposite of this is a fixed mindeset in which a
			person in that state mentally believes that abilities is a natural reality
			and that it can not be developed with effort.
		</p>

		<p>
			I believe in order for me or anyone to be in this type of mindset requires
			motivation inspiration and a postive attitude. Reason being is you need to
			have a catalyst for change. You need to have a reason as to why you want
			to change. There also needs to be a good attitude in order for you to
			follow up on the expectations you have set for yourself to be able to
			grow. Having a good attitude will allow you remain consistent on the task
			at hand. Hopefull you have gotten something out of this blog that you can
			implement to make a postive change in your life. I have added a link below
			to a website if you would like to know more on the subject of developing a
			growth mindset.
