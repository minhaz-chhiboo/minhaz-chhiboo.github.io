        <h3>Describe your core personal values?</h3>

        <p>My core personal values are:

            <li>Respect</li>
            <li>Loyalty</li>
            <li>Justice</li>
        </p>

        <h3>Explain a situation where you had an ethical decision to make. </h3>
        <p>A friend of mine had some legal issues in regards to his residency in a foreign country. He did not have much time or support as he was being told to leave the country. Because he was alone in a foreign country he needed help to relocate but also to help with the legal side. He could not find anyone to go there and help him. He called me asking for help so I booked a return ticket to go over there and help him move back. I did this at my own expense and while taking time off from work. The reason I went to this extent to help him was because a few years back I was going through tough times and he really helped me out when I needed it. Because loyalty is a very high up on my list of values  I had left everything and went to help to show that I am very much loyal to the people who stood by me In times of difficulty. It had costed me time and money but this is representation of my value system.</p>

        <h3>Describe how your culture has influenced your values and identity</h3>
        <p>My culture did not really influence me in my set of moral values and ethics but my religion definitely has. My religion has a legislation which one needs to adhere to so that he may be guided in this world so I try my best to act on the practises outlined in our holy book.</p>

        <h3>Evaluate your strengths and limitations in terms of your learning and career development</h3>
        <p>I believe a strength of mine is a willingness to learn new things even though they may be difficult.</p>

        <My>My limitations is my habits that I have developed from a young age such as not having discipline, not being able to focus on the task at hand(procrastination) and poor time management and being far too easily distracted. My limitations or bad habits stated above were made apparent while I was working on building a mobile application with a group of friends but because I had to many things going on and due to not being able to time manage  and focus the project to build an app took way longer then it should hence causing lots of tension within the group.</p>

        <p>Currently I am trying to overcome my limitations but have not been able to find good resources to help with my time management and my nature of procrastinating.
