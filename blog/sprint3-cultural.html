  <h1>Emotional Intelligence versus IQ</h1>

  <h3>Hi and welcome to my latest blog post. In this post I will be sharing some information about my research on the topic of Emotional Intelligence, what it is, how is it different and why it is so important.

  </h3>

  <h5>So lets get started, What is EQ ? </h5>
  <p>
    For those of you who are not too familliar with the term EQ it is simply short for emotional quotient otherwise knows as emotional intelligence. Emotional intelligence is the ability to understand manage and make use of your emotions in a postive manner to relieve stress improve your focus, become a better communicater and overcome challenges. There are many benefits of mastering emotional intelligence which can then benefit yourself as well as having an impact on those around you by being able to understand there emotions better.

    <p>Below are the five catergories of self awareness:
    <li>Self-awareness</li>
    <li>self-management</li>
    <li>Motivation</li>
    <li>Empathy</li>
    <li>Social communication</li></p>

    <p>In short having a high EQ simply just means having a really good ability to have a deep awareness of your own emotions as well as the emotions of others and being able to translate that information to guide your thinking and that of others.</p>

  <h5>How is it different to IQ?</h5>
  <p>
    So if you have made it this far you maybe thinking how is EQ different to IQ. Well IQ is simply short for intelligence quotient, it is basically a measure of a persons reasoning ability. It may be used to gauge a persons reasoning ability or a persons ability to utilise informations and logic to answer questions or make predictions.

    <h5>Why is EQ so important?</h5>
    Reaserch shows that EQ has a direct corelation to a better quality of life and potential success than IQ.
    It is safe to say that a person with a higher EQ is much more employable, healthier and happier and has more success in manageing relationships. The good news is EQ can be taught, think of it like soft skills. Some of us have been blessed with people who may have taught us to pay attention to the way we feel at times and have aided us in manageing these feelings this is a good foundation to build on. For the rest of us it is not too say that it is too late too start.
