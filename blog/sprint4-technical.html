			<h3>Thanks for visiting my Sprint 4 Technical blog.</h3>

			<h2>Problems during the sprint</h2>

			<p class="p1">
				There were many road blocks during this sprint but one that I could
				recall was the code readability challenge. I was having difficulty
				trying to adjust tab spaces, but after watching a youtube video on it
				and playing around with the settings in vs code I had managed to get
				there.
			</p>
			<h2>Problem Solving</h2>
			<p class="p1">
				Another problem I was facing challenges on was recalling how to execute
				java script functions during the kata challenges. The way I managed to
				working around this was using a java script cheat sheet book that I have
				which helps in creating and executing functions. During the process I
				felt very fustrated as I was falling behind and had so much to catch up
				on.
			</p>
			<h2>
				How confident do you feel using the problem solving techniques and
				process
			</h2>
			<p class="p1">
				I am still trying to get to grips with sprint 4 but I am semi confident
				now in reading error messages. I utilised the rubber duckymethod to help
				me solve some of the error while doing the challenges. I did not have a
				duck but I used my action figure toy instead. It helped me a lot as I
				was explain the problem it was making more sense as I was breaking it
				down line by line. I am still working on building my confidence in
				asking my peers for help when I get stuck, I tend to usually only ask if
				I am really stuck and am desperate for help.
			</p>

			<h4>
				Some of the ways I was able to find answers and get through difficult
				periods during the foundations program was by using the resources on the
				internet. I had opened up tabs in my browser for sites such as stack
				overflow youtube w3 schools and other websites which I found on google.
				This way I was able to search for the relevant information and this
				really helped my learning. I am using Pseudocode and I fell it helps me
				clarify what I need to do in terms of writing the code. I am not that
				confident in useing console.logging but I am expecting to become more
				confident the more I use it. I am also semi confident in reading error
				messages as sometimes they can be confusing and overwhelming.
